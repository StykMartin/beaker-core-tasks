This test is for starting/stopping virtual guest in a virtual workflow. It can
be called with no test arguments at all in which case it'll go thru each and
every guest defined in the test thru guestrecipes and will start and stop them
in order. 
Optional arguments are GUESTSTARTSTOP_ARGS and VIRTEST_TIMEOUT .
GUESTSTARTSTOP_ARGS argument can be used to specify which guests are needed to
be started/stopped. For most, this is not needed to be provided because the
test, by default, with start and stop each and every guest. VIRTEST_TIMEOUT
argument is used to specify the timeout to wait how long it takes the guest to
start or stop. Note that, when the guest starts, it does run every beaker test
specified in the guest recipe as part of the init process, so this should be
taken into the account. If this argument is not provided, then there will be no
timeout.

For most cases neither one of the arguments should be needed.
