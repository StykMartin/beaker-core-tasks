Purpose: This test does absolutely nothing. The only reason to use this test
is align multihost tests in a recipe set, as each multihost test must be
executed in the same relative position on each host. For example (other
elements omitted for clarity):

<recipeSet>
  <recipe>
    <task role='STANDALONE' name='/distribution/install'/>
    <task role='STANDALONE' name='/my/test/number1'/>
    <task role='SERVERS'    name='/my/multihost/test'/>
  </recipe>
  <recipe>
    <task role='STANDALONE' name='/distribution/install'/>
    <task role='STANDALONE' name='/distribution/utils/dummy'/>
    <task role='CLIENTS'    name='/my/multihost/test'/>
  </recipe>
</recipeSet>
