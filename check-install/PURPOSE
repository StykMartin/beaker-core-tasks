Performs some sanity checks about the operating system installation which was
done at the start of the recipe. Also reports various facts about the state and
configuration of the system which might be useful in debugging installation
problems.

This task is intended to be included as the first task in every Beaker recipe.
It replaces the /distribution/install task which was previously used for this
purpose.
